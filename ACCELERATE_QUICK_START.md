## 🔥 Your Next Steps (To Fix Neon Limit Reached)

### Step 1: Sign Up for Prisma Cloud (5 minutes)
1. Go to: https://cloud.prisma.io
2. Create a free account
3. Create a new project called "Emperor POS"

### Step 2: Connect Accelerate to Neon (3 minutes)
1. In Prisma Cloud, go to **Project Settings** → **Accelerate**
2. Click **"Create Accelerate connection"**
3. Select **Neon PostgreSQL**
4. Enter your Neon connection string:
   ```
   postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_Lb6CFeydB2jx@ep-dawn-heart-agcyndmo-pooler.c-2.eu-central-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require
   ```
5. Save - you'll get your Accelerate URL (`prisma://...`)

### Step 3: Update Vercel Environment Variables (2 minutes)
1. Go to your Vercel project → Settings → Environment Variables
2. Add/Update these variables:

   ```
   DATABASE_URL=prisma://YOUR-ACCELERATE-URL-HERE
   DIRECT_URL=postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_Lb6CFeydB2jx@ep-dawn-heart-agcyndmo-pooler.c-2.eu-central-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require
   ```

3. Select all environments (Production, Preview, Development)
4. Save

### Step 4: Deploy (Automatic)
1. Vercel will automatically redeploy
2. Or manually: Deployments → Redeploy
